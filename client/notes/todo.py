# TODO: we need to rework action management lol its ass

# TODO: refactor things so they actually work with storing the tile on the unit table
# namely, this is an issue with targetEnemy and targetAlly
# they return a tileRef which isn't needed

# TODO: rework the Chosen (sacrament's minor power) to use the tag system
# currently it uses gamestate in a strange way

#TODO: add to unitPlacement:
# something that explains what is happening
# another unit display panel that tells you what each unit is when you hover it

#TODO: the sniper ability leaves you at -1 actions

# ! BUG: many alerts are too large to display
# ! BUG: some unit names don't fit, like The Envoy, when **Chosen**
# ! BUG: need a way to cancel powers once you activate them
